# [Wine Quality Clustering](https://wine-clustering-predictor.streamlit.app/)
## Project Description
In this machine learning project, the objective is to cluster wines based on their quality using the KMeans algorithm. The dataset used contains a total of 13 features that provide various chemical compositions of the wines. To enhance the model's efficiency and interpretability, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for dimensionality reduction. Additionally, the optimal number of clusters is determined through the Elbow method, ensuring meaningful and insightful wine categorization.

## Input Features
#### 1. Alcohol
##### The alcohol content is a crucial factor affecting wine quality. Adjust the slider to specify the desired alcohol content for the prediction.

##### 2. Malic Acid
Malic acid contributes to the tartness of wines. Set the slider to indicate the malic acid content.

##### 3. Ash
Ash content represents the mineral composition in wines. Slide to define the desired ash content.

##### 4. Ash Alcanity
Ash alkalinity is a measure of the basicity of wines. Adjust the slider to specify the ash alkalinity.

##### 5. Magnesium
The magnesium content is a significant factor in wine quality. Set the slider to indicate the magnesium content.

##### 6. Total Phenols
Total phenols contribute to the taste and color of wines. Slide to specify the desired total phenols.

##### 7. Flavanoids
Flavanoids add flavor and color to wines. Adjust the slider to define the flavanoids content.

##### 8. Nonflavanoid Phenols
Nonflavanoid phenols also contribute to the taste and color of wines. Set the slider accordingly.

##### 9. Proanthocyanins
Proanthocyanins are antioxidants present in wines. Slide to indicate the proanthocyanins content.

##### 10. Color Intensity
Color intensity is a crucial visual aspect of wines. Adjust the slider to define the desired color intensity.

##### 11. Hue
Hue represents the color shade of wines. Set the slider to specify the desired hue.

##### 12. OD280
OD280 is a measure of the optical density of wines. Slide to indicate the desired OD280.

##### 13. Proline
Proline content is associated with the taste and quality of wines. Adjust the slider to define the proline content.

## Making Predictions
After setting the input features, click the 'Predict' button to obtain the model's prediction for the wine's cluster. The model has been trained on the original dataset to accurately categorize wines into distinct clusters.

Feel free to experiment with different input values to explore how the model classifies wines based on their chemical compositions.
